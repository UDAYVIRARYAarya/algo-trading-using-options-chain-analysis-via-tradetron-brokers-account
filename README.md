# 🚀 Advanced Automated Options Trading System generated using AI needs professional help to improve the code

An AI-powered, fully automated options trading engine for the Nifty Index, designed to **sell options** (SHORT CALL/PUT) based on real-time data, machine learning models, and quantitative risk controls. It integrates with **Tradetron API** for live execution and supports continuous learning and simulation.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ SHORT CALL/PUT Strategy (Signal: -1, +1, 0)
- ✅ Ensemble ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)
- ✅ Real-time NSE option chain analysis
- ✅ 35+ features: OI, Volume, PCR, Volatility, Time, etc.
- ✅ Tradetron API integration for live signal execution
- ✅ Offline simulation + reinforcement learning
- ✅ Risk-managed: SL, targets, Kelly sizing, exposure caps
- ✅ SHAP-based explainability
- ✅ Modular architecture with fallback and recovery

## 🧠 Trading Strategy

| Signal | Action      | Logic                     |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| +1     | SHORT PUT   | Expecting price to fall   |
| -1     | SHORT CALL  | Expecting price to fall   |
| 0      | Neutral     | Exit all/open no position |

> 💰 Profits are generated when the shorted option premium drops.
