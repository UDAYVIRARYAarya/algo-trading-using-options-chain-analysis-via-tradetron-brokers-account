## 🎯 Signal Types

| Signal | Type | Action | Profit Logic |
|--------|------|--------|--------------|
| **+1** | 🟢 SHORT PUT | Sell PUT option | Profit when PUT price ↓ |
| **-1** | 🔴 SHORT CALL | Sell CALL option | Profit when CALL price ↓ |
| **0** | ⚪ NEUTRAL | Exit/No position | Close existing positions |

## 🧠 ML Components

### Models Used:
